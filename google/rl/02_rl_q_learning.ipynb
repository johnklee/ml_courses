In <b><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning'>supervised learning</a></b>, the loss is the gradient of the loss function, which is the delta between the predicted and actual values. In RL, the loss is the gradient of the delta between the newly estimated return and the old estimate of the return."
